# decoder-ring

You are planning a surprise birthday party for one of your friends who loves escape rooms and puzzles. What better way to practice your new coding skills than to build an application that will help you encode and decode all kinds of fun messages?

This project is designed to test your ability to build tricky algorithms as well as write unit tests with Mocha and Chai. Before taking on this module, you should be comfortable with the following:

Installing packages via NPM
Modifying the package.json file with new scripts
Running tests from the command line
Writing JavaScript functions
Writing tests for specific functions
Iterating through strings, objects, and arrays
Debugging through reading errors and using the VSCode debugger

<h2> Instructions </h2>
You are tasked with building functions for an application that will either encode or decode a string using a variety of ciphers. For each cipher, you should make a series of tests using Mocha and Chai to confirm that your cipher works.

All of the functions can be found inside of the src/ directory. Each function and cipher is described below.

Below is a checklist of what you need to accomplish.

<p> [ ] Complete the caesar() function. </p>
<p> [ ] Write tests for the caesar() function. </p>
<p> [ ] Complete the polybius() function. </p>
<p> [ ] Write tests for the polybius() function. </p>
<p> [ ] Complete the substitution() function. </p>
<p> [ ] Write tests for the substitution() function. </p>
